# The Dogma Metagame

We have known for sometime that consent is manufactured by authorities and institutions, but somehow, the way dogma operates in the present time feels different:

* There are establishment narratives - corporate and government - historically, these are narratives that dominate but also ones that intellectuals writ large have been skeptical of.
* There are contrarion narratives - these range from reasonable and necessary to needlessly contrarion and prone to hyperbolistic conspiracy thinking.
* There are (or there used to be) settled narratives - common fact or knowledge that was taken for granted. Any mistakes in such narratives, if identified, were attributed to sincere motives, and the narrative was readily corrected to incorporate what was found to be correct. Regardless of what the bedrock of your beliefs was, you would probably at least subscribe to these.

Growing up, I learned to be cautious of establishment narratives, skeptical of contrarion ones, and base any strong opinions on settled ones. However, now (December of 2022 as I write this) there seem to be no settled narratives - no common truth. There is never a convergence from an esblishment or contration narrative to a settled one; indeed it seems the infrastructure of common belief is broken now that legacy media has lost the ability to manufacture consent (this is not universally bad - they did pedal a lot that was dishonest - but I'm not sure the internet/social media based segmented consent forming is an improvment).

The death of consensus making mechanisms for honest narratives has been talked about for a while. However, that mechanisms exist to manufacture non-settled narratives and have them become accepted by their target audiences is what seems to be truly insidious. I imagine these narratives look settled to these targets but for someone on the outside looking in, it seems like establishment and contrarion narratives have intermingled to a point where power structures that want to manufacture various types of consent keep flooding the channel with incestuous cousins of these types of narratives. Perhaps the only way to get back to honest, settled narratives is not to create a mechanism for constructing those but to filter out anything that isn't that; to understand the metagame.

My evolving list for filtering out anything that seems non-settled/manufactured in the service of a non-sincere and/or malicious motive is simple:

* Dogma is Hyperbolic - Overly positive or negative - I've been struck by the myth making and moonshot promises of recent fradulent firms like Theranos is particular.
* Dogma is Emotional (and often self-righteous)
* Dogma uses a Facade of Nuance
* Dogma is often being used to advance an interest
