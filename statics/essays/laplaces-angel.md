# Laplace's Angel

I decided sometime ago to try and not offer unsolicited advice to anyone (and be careful to not offer it in most cases even if I'm explicitly asked). This was not easy to do. Offering advice, particularly when it seems valuable and **reflects well on oneself** is quite mentally rewarding - consequently, I don't know how well I've done with regard to this maxim but I will continue trying.

Why do this? Because like most people I don't really **know** much despite having some shreds of knowledge gift-wrapped in my personal opinions. This idea is not original by any means. It rests on the shoulders of what's been described as the problem of induction by Karl Popper. In another form, it's been called the Black Swan by the prickly Taleb. But I think it goes even further - we don't know even when we know better sometimes.

At present, I have decided that the fundamental unknowability of life is actually a good thing, at least in part. It is an angelic facet of existence that fights against the frightening possibility of [Laplace's demon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_demon). Simply put, knowing everything would just be no fun. I will try to organize some thoughts about my personal epistemics in what follows (perhaps even making a mental note of the current state of the world, and my assumptions about its trajectory so that I can visit back to review and self correct and reveal even more flaws - like most of what I write, this is a living document that will likely change over time).

## The Many Opinions of Sports Fans

Team sports are an interesting phenomenon and fertile ground for compelling stories to emerge. I grew up watching cricket and football (soccer) and heard with great fascination, the theorizing of family and friends as to why a team does not perform well: Lacking squad selection, deficiences in man management, bad assessment of conditions (typically relevant to cricket pitches), the wrong formation (in the setup of the playing eleven around a football pitch), team chemistry, players with a bad attitude and lacking work ethic, and so on.

You can pick your favorite story, and will be lauded in your social circles if the story you picked was compelling enough to justify your prediction in retrospect. I read [a book about money-balling football](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17465493-the-numbers-game) that tilted me the other way briefly - from intuitive stories and causal explanation to statistics as a revealer of truth, but even here the authors drift into being a little too sure of their methods. One point they make is compelling though; most sports, and football in particular, are in large part determined by luck when the resources, fitness, and skills of teams are within fine margins of each other.

My current prespective is that the success of teams is cyclical (similar to market cycles). Teams that have ample resources to buy the most talented players, hire the most talented coaches, nutrition and health experts, statisticians and tacticians, will do well - losing some and winning some when they meet teams of the same means within competitions. The resources the teams have are largely dependent on social, cultural, economic, and even political factors (for example the rise of foreign backed teams in European soccer in the 2000s). Of course even this more general hand-wavy model is limited - the system is too complex to be modeled. At some point in the future, I plan to expand on this by exploring the statistics related to club football (there's a few datasets on Kaggle that look promising).

## Investors Don't Know Anything (Mostly?)

At first I read about genius investors and success coaches. This is how most people start, by hearing about the legendary investing prowess of Warren Buffet and contemplating how his multi-decade effort and practices for managing a several-hundered-billion dollar enterprise can be used to drive similar results for one's personal portfolio. Then I read about random walks and the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). This led to a period during which I thought there's information around to give you an edge but that it dries up amongst the flurry of smart-money-flash-boy-quants so EMH mostly stands with exceptions. Finally I was exposed to the ideas of Taleb and watched enough documentaries about financial crises to realize that even EMH can be hogwash - you can mine efficiency and lack of turbulence from any system for a time before the tide changes dramatically.

The markets, like most emergent phenomenon, are [complex adaptive systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system). When behaving themselves, these systems seem cyclical. [There is even a combination of monetary and fiscal policy that may work in concert to engineer the cherished soft-landing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0). However, they seem to buck prediction for the most part, and trying to stabalize them too much leads to the inverse over time - violent swings, and aggregation (culminating in too big to fail actors within the system) which actually strips the system of the properties that make it resilient (I have not read [Antifragile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile_(book)) yet but I imagine Taleb dives into this with more wit and obnoxiousness than I am right now). Like most people, I am not in a position to dictate policy so my only option for the moment is what Taleb refers to as [a barbell strategy](https://www.wealest.com/articles/barbell-strategy) with some caveats. In a nutshell, invest conservatively, or in my case aggressively but without a risk of leverage induced blow-up in generally reliable financial instruments while repeatedly attempting to gain exposure to events with violent upside potential.

A final note on whether or not complex adaptive systems can ever be understood well enough to make accurate predictions - probably not but I think there are tools emerging that make understanding these system more tractable. We live in a time where compute is becoming abundant and modeling simple actors within these systems and running simulations allow some level of empiricism to combine with all the theorizing that is typical in these disciplines. [Thomas Simon's economy simulator](https://thomassimon.dev/ps/4) is a great toy version of this approach in action. [The work of Doyne Farmer and others in forecasting macroeconomic trends using agentic simulation techniques seems like an interesting path forward here](https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/publications/no-2024-06-forecasting-macroeconomic-dynamics-using-a-calibrated-data-driven-agent-based-model).

I will have more to say about my personal epistemics and what I read regarding all of this in upcoming sections I plan to write:

* **Politicians Don't Know Anything (But Still, Try To Elect Good Ones)**
* **Executives Don't Know Anything (But Some Are Quite Lucky)**
* **Doctor's Don't Know Anything (Sort Of?)**
* **I Don't Know Anything**
